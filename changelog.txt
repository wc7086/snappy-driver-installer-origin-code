 update torrent, a value of 2 selects the driver packs update torrent.

Version 0.7.0.576

Added new Metro theme.
Updated source file headers for Origin.
Moved to conventional version numbers.

Miscellaneous small changes and fixes.

Updated bitmaps and icons for Origin.
Transifex is no longer used. If you want to help out with translations,
 contact me on the Patreon page.
Updated default Metallic theme.
Added -getdevicelist command line option.
Changed the executable names to SDIO_*.
The torrent url is now hard coded again.

Version 0.5.0.554
23 April 2017
Driver Packs 17043
Updated version number
Welcome screen completed. It appears when there are no driver packs and indexes
 found and no command line arguments given (ie new users).
Updated torrent agent id.
Moved some themes out to Additional Themes.
Moved Select Driver Dir to system menu.
Added seeding option to Updates dialog. This keeps the update session running,
 seeding all files that have been downloaded. When the update session is stopped
 by clicking on the update button, the updates are processed in the normal
 fashion. This is perfect if you leave updates running overnight.
Added 'Seed driver packs' option to the System Menu. At any time when not doing
 updates, you can switch this on to enable sharing of the driver packs in your
 working "drivers" directory. Sometimes it wants to do a little downloading
 first, this is a quirk in the bittorrent protocol and is normal and
 unavoidable. This is different to the seeding option on the Updates dialog.
Added more status feedback from the torrent.
Added 'Checking for updates' status on startup.
Added web page hyperlinks to Welcome screen and About box.
In case you're wondering why the executable suddenly got bigger, it's
 because I no longer use the exe packer to compress it.
Remove No Drivers Available message if not checking for updates.
Updated torrent trackers.
Prevent autoclose after autoupdate if autoinstall is also present.
A bunch of small changes and fixes.
